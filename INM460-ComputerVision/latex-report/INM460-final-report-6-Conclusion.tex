We processed files containing analogue signals subject to radio frequency interference. We visualised the data and made inferences about the particular characteristcs of signal and noise. We then engineered features to aid us in analysing the distinction between these two characteristics. We created a linear regression model to inform us when noise filtering was required. We compared filtered and unfiltered signals and validated our results by demonstrating that our linear regression algorithm showed <TODO marker goes here> noise ratios in our filtered data was at levels comparable to non-filtered signal data.
